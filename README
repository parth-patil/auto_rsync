Handy tool to setup a recursive watcher on a directory and rsync modified files to a remote host

If you get an error saying that "upper limit on inotify watches reached", you will have to increase the max watches allowed for users. Using the following
# cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
8192
# echo 16000 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
# cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
16000
